;;; Commentary:

;; Execute BODY with Python virtual environment activated with `with-venv-dir' macro:

;; (with-venv-dir (expand-file-name ".venv" default-directory)
;;   (executable-find "python"))


;; Alternatively, make this package try to find venv directory automatically
;; with `with-venv':

;; (with-venv
;;   (executable-find "python"))


;; This macro uses `with-venv-find-venv-dir' to find suitable venv directory:
;; this function currently support pipenv, poetry, and can find directories
;; named ".venv".
;; Or, you can set buffer-local vairable `with-venv-venv-dir' to explicitly
;; specify which venv directory to use.


;; If you want to always enable `with-venv' for certain functions, you can use
;; `with-venv-advice-add':

;; (with-venv-advice-add 'blacken-buffer)

;; Adviced functions are always wrapped with `with-venv' macro when called.

;; To remove these advices, you can use `with-venv-advice-remove'.
